		NDC Porto is a leading developer conference held annually in Porto,
		Portugal. It brings together speakers and attendees from across the
		software ecosystem to share practical talks, workshops, and deep dives
		on .NET, web, cloud, and modern development practices.
		<img src="kitten-400px.jpg" alt="Kitten!">
		The event offers a friendly, community-driven atmosphere for learning
		and
		networking. Developers of all levels attend to discover new techniques,
		collaborate with peers, and stay current with industry trends and
		tooling.
	</p>
	<p>

		Each year the program features a balanced mix of keynote talks, breakout
		sessions, and hands-on workshops. Speakers are chosen for both depth of
		expertise and the ability to make complex topics approachable — from
		cutting-edge language features to pragmatic architecture advice.
		<img src="kitten-400px.jpg" alt="Kitten!">
		Workshops provide extended, instructor-led time to dig into topics like
		performance tuning, testing strategies, cloud-native design, and
		developer tooling. Attendees often leave with runnable code samples and
		a clearer roadmap for adopting new practices back at work.
	</p>
	<p>The conference emphasizes community and mentorship: lightning talks,
		birds-of-a-feather meetups, and dedicated newcomer tracks make it easy
		to connect with peers, find collaborators, and get practical feedback on
		ideas or challenges you’re facing.
