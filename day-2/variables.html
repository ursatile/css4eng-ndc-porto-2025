		<h1>Hey! I'm in dark mode!</h1>
		<p>In the quiet hours, small details reveal themselves: a chipped paint on a windowsill, the soft echo of footsteps in an empty hall, the way light pools around a book left open on a table.</p>
		<p>Conversations weave through the day like threads in a tapestry, sometimes bright and loud, sometimes barely there. Each exchange leaves a trace â€” a new idea, a lingering question, a smile remembered.</p>
		<p>Outside, the city hums with activity. People move with purpose and pause in equal measure, carrying stories that never fully meet the surface but shape the rhythm of each neighborhood.</p>
		<p>Evening brings a different perspective. Ordinary objects gain quiet significance, and the mind finds room to wander along paths of small imaginings and gentle curiosities.</p>
